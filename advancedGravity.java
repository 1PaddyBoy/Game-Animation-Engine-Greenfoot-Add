     * any that don't have that might break if changed 
     * list of all variables which can be changed:
     * 
     * there are a few styles I have done, for exaple mario which makes it more like that style. I plan to make more. 
     * styles like mario don't do everything, there are still alot of things to change with it. 
     * 
     * there are currently two different ways this can be used, one where it is just the gravity and one where it has gravity and jump commands.
     * 
     *  to make sprites pull sprites initilize this. some number should be same as move speed for best results 
     *  speedpulls = (some number); // this is the speed it pulls this if it moves things that are on top, this will look most realistic as the same as the movmeent speed in the array below but if its a tread mill or something it can be higher 
        movesthing = true; // this is if it moves things with it, again change this in the array below too but this helps a bit 
        col = true; //this doesn't do as much any more its more of a back up but this should be here as well as the class name in the array below
